Information: 

For this application we used mongoose and Mongodb to create a database for daily entries and Users. We used React components for our frontend and bootstrap for styling. Users can register or sign-in if they already have an account and add, edit or delete entries to log their daily habits and potential symptoms- the application contains full CRUD functionality.


Features to continue working on: 

1.) Ability for User to upload an image for each entry via Cloudinary
2.) Ability for User to mark their location for each entry on a map, via google maps or mapbox.
